    opinion: "A classic among classics in the programming world. Although in the midst of 2023, I have a somewhat controversial opinion. It doesn't seem like a book I would recommend to everyone, especially to those who are learning. Additionally, it has a very dogmatic tone, and there are people who dangerously treat it as the bible of development. But if you can read it with perspective, there are still interesting things that are relevant. Note that all code examples are based on Java and heavily focus on object-oriented programming.",
